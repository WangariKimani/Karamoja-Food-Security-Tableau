# Karamoja-Food-Security-Tableau
This project is about gauging the food security in different districts in Uganda using data that contains the land area, district area map, production of soghurm and maize as well as the yield per hectare of both soghurm and maize. 
The first sheet shows the district with the highest yield in hectares of maize and soghurm.
The second sheet shows the crop with the highest yield in general.
The third sheet shows the comparison of the various districts against the yield/population ratio. 
The forth sheet shows the unutilized land area in the various districts.
Sheet 5 shows the districts map with the districts' respective population, maize yield and soghurm yield.
Finally, we have a dashboard that shows our most relevant sheets that give a summary of the food security in Karamoja.
